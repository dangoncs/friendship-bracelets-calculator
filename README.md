# Friendship Bracelets Calculator

Are you a fan of Taylor Swift and going to The Eras Tour, or simply watching the movie on theaters? Either way, this program is for you, Swiftie!

This is a program that calculates how many beads are needed to craft a friendship bracelet for any given word/phrase. This allows you to save money by buying only the amount you really need of each specific letter, so that you can skip to the fun part: trading bracelets with friends and other Swifties.

I hope this project is useful to you!
